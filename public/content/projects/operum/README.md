# Operum

Operum is a personal and collaborative data tracking app. Instead of wrestling with spreadsheets, you define exactly the data you want to track, how to view it, and how to visualize it — all in one place.

## What You Can Do

### Build Custom Trackers
A tracker is a collection of data you care about — a reading list, a workout log, a bug database, anything. You define the structure by adding fields with the types that make sense for your data: text, numbers, dates, and more. Up to 25 fields per tracker, each with its own label, description, ordering, and visibility.

### Log Entries
Once a tracker is set up, you start adding entries. Each entry fills in the fields you've defined. You can create, edit, and delete individual entries or bulk-delete a selection. If you already have data elsewhere, you can import it directly from a CSV file. You can also export your data to CSV at any time.

### Create Views
A view is a saved lens on your tracker's data. You can filter by field values, set sort orders, and choose which columns are visible. Switch between views to see the same data from different angles without losing your other configurations. Each tracker can have a default view that opens automatically.

### Visualize with Analytics
Add charts to a tracker to turn raw entries into visual summaries. Configure what data each chart uses, then see all your charts laid out in a masonry grid. Charts update as your data changes.

### Collaborate
Trackers can be shared with other users. Add teammates or friends to a tracker so they can view and contribute entries. Each tracker has its own set of collaborators.

### Use Templates
Admins can publish public template trackers that other users can use as a starting point. Browse available templates and build on top of them instead of starting from scratch.

### Accounts & Access
- Sign up with email and password, or log in with Google
- Email confirmation on registration
- Account lockout after repeated failed login attempts
- Two roles: **User** (create and manage trackers, collaborate) and **Admin** (everything, plus user management and platform configuration)

## Self-Hosting

Operum runs as a Docker Compose stack — backend API, frontend, PostgreSQL, and optional Prometheus + Grafana monitoring.

### Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose

### Setup

1. Configure the backend:

   ```bash
   cp backend/src/Operum.API/appsettings.Example.txt backend/src/Operum.API/appsettings.json
   # Edit appsettings.json — set database connection string, JWT key, Mailgun credentials, Google Client ID
   ```

2. Configure the frontend:

   ```bash
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
   # Edit .env — set VITE_REACT_API_URL and VITE_REACT_GOOGLE_CLIENT
   ```

3. Start everything:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
